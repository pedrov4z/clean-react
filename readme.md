This system is part of professor Rodrigo Manguinho's training at Udemy.

The objective of this training is to show how to create a system in ReactJs using the new Hooks, Recoil, with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD (test-oriented programming) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS and applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
